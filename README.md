# Happy
Happy is a project made in NLW #03 (Next Week Level Edition 3 from Rocket Seat). 
The idea is to make an app with a web version and mobile version, that helps people to visit Foster Homes, which used to be called an orphanage, informing what they need to know to get there and be able to enter.

# Installation
To get started, you may want to download the project zip file or use ``git clone https://github.com/gustavonikov/Happy``.

You will have the 3 folders containing the front-web project, front-mobile project and the back-end project, each one
of them, possess they own README.md, that will guide you through.

### WARNING
The project server is offline, so, you won't be able to navigate properly on the app, but you can see the layout :)
